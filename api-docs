Problems I have:
I forget to upload my receipts and add my transactions. I like to wait until the Point-Of-Sale transaction
commits on my credit card.
Solution:
Pipeline to upload (or create) receipt > add to work queue > go through in batch
Requires: receipt endpoint (image or text i.e. partial txn)
Honestly this doesnt require an additional work queue, they can just be in the regular list but marked,
with a checkbox to filter by the ones that need attention, so needs the edit endpoint

Sometimes I make a purchase that includes other things
Requires: itemization: frontend work and backend type structure

I want to see my monthly breakdowns better
Requires:
- Better UI interface for date selection
- Fixing the salary setter (see next)

I want more useful verification. I need to know if my CC statement is the same. I need to know what is
going in and out of Venmo. I should be processing my paystubs.
Requires:
- Ledger page: account balances; transfer transaction for Venmo transfers
This needs more thought

I want to see my disposable income. I want to see if I can be putting more towards myself or other accounts
i.e. investments, charity.
Requires: Targets on Pie Chart

I want to set temporary goals i.e. saving for a trip or something
Reuiqres: Temporary targets

I want to see the growth of my other accounts
Requires:
- Ledger/account page w graph view

I want to see more what-if conditions: like lower or higher rent etc

Stretch goal: alternate view with water system and investing / self feedback loops
